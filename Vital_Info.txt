It is one of only two major rivers in peninsular India that runs from east to west (longest west flowing river), along with the Tapti River. It is one of the rivers in India that flows in a rift valley, bordered by the Satpura and Vindhya ranges. As a rift valley river, the Narmada does not form a delta; Rift valley rivers form estuaries. Other rivers which flow through the rift valley include the Damodar River in Chota Nagpur Plateau and Tapti. The Tapti River and Mahi River also flow through rift valleys, but between different ranges. It flows through the states of Madhya Pradesh (1,077 km (669.2 mi)), and Maharashtra, (74 km (46.0 mi)), (39 km (24.2 mi)) (actually along the border between Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra (39 km (24.2 mi)) and then the border between Maharashtra and Gujarat (74 km (46.0 mi)) and in Gujarat (161 km (100.0 mi)).[4]

The Periplus Maris Erythraei (c. 80 AD) called the river the Namnadius (Ναμνάδιος),[5] Ptolemy called it Namadus (Νάμαδος) and Namades (Ναμάδης)[6] and the British Raj called it the Nerbudda or Narbada.[7][8] Narmada is a Sanskrit word meaning "The Giver of Pleasure".[9]
